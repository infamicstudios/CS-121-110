3. Instructions (recipe) calculate the average height of everyone in the room by Duncan Mcfarlane
10 output introduction
15 set sum = 0
16 set count = 0
17 set average = 0
20 prompt for height
25 user input height
40 set height = height
50 set count = count + 1
60 if their are uncounted proplr left in the room then skip to the calculated people
70 set average = sum/count
80 output lable "the average age of is "
85 ask for more heights if more hights are wanted go back to 20
90 Done


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1:
What is being tested: their are 3 people in the room.    
Input values if any: heights are 48, 63, 55	
And expected result = count = 3, sum =166, average = 55.33
15 sum =0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your height?
30 height =48
40 sum = 0+1=1
60 skip to instruction 20
30 height = 63
sum =48+63=111
50 count = 1+1=2
60 true so skip to instruction 20
20 what is your age
30 age = 55
40 sum = 55+111=166
50 Count = 2+1=3
60 false
70 average = 166 /3 = 55.33
80 the average age of everyone is 55.33
90 Done

Test case #2: invalid age
there are 3 people in the room
input: heights are -1, 20, and 1000
15 sum =0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your height?
30 age = -1
40 sum = -1
60 skip to instruction 20
