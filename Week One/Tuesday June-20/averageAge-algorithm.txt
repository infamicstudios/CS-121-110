3. Instructions (recipe) calculate the average age of everyone in the room by Duncan Mcfarlane and COMPSC 1021-110
10 output introduction
15 set sum = 0
16 set count = 0
17 set average = 0
** getting the age of everyone in the room **
**getting the total number of people in the room**
**summed all the ages of the people in the room**
20 output prompt "what is your age"
30 input age
40 set sum = sum + age
50 set count = count + 1
60 if their are uncounted proplr left in the room then skip to the calculated people
70 set average = sum/count
80 output lable "the average age of everyone in the room is "
90 Done


4. Test Cases
Test Case#1:
What is being tested: their are 3 people in the room.    
Input values if any: ages are 21, 31, 41	
And expected result = count = 3, sum =93, average = 31
15 sum =0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your age?
30 age =21
40 sum = 0+1=1
60 skip to instruction 20
30 age = 31
sum =21+31=52
50 count = 1+1=2
60 true so skip to instruction 20
20 what is your age
30 age = 41
40 sum = 52+41=93
50 Count = 2+1=3
60 false
70 average = 93 /3 = 31
80 the average age of everyone is 31
90 Done

Test case #2: invalid age
there are 3 people in the room
input: ages are -1, 20, and 10
15 sum =0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your age?
30 age = -1
40 sum = -1
60 skip to instruction 20
30 invalid number

Test case #2: decimal age
there are 3 people in the room
input: ages are 1.25, 20, and 10
15 sum =0
16 count = 0
17 average = 0
20 What is your age?
30 age = 1.25
40 sum = 1.25
30 invalid number must be a whole number.
