the 3 subcatagories for system are operating system, language translator, and utilities'
the 3 subcatagories for application are entertainment, productivity, and utilities

the three language translators are a compiler which translates normal code to lower lever language
an assembler which translate assembly into machine code and an interprester which translates high level launguage to low level language.
